# passwordgenerator


## Features

In this project, I used variable, functions, for loops, and if statements to generate a randomized password. 

The feature has a series of promts, asking users what they would like to have inside of the password. After the prompts have been chosen, the password will generate based off of the data that was given by the user. 

After the password is generated, the user can also generate again if they did not like the password that was generated.
